# Follow-Rabbit

This is a 3D prototype game. The game starts with computer player moving from square to square in a board. The player tries to memorize the route of computer player. After the computer player completes the random route the player is spawned in the square where computer player started its movement. When computer player completes the route game ends. If player goes out of route then game restarts. By default the route length is 5.

This project was developed on Unity version 2021.3.5f1 Apple Silicon.
